# Hivecom ZNC Theme #

This is the official Hivecom ZNC theme. It is based off of a skin from
[zncstrap](https://github.com/ProjectFirrre/zncstrap) and has been heavily
modified to fit the Hivecom design. As well as that it fixes some bugs the
original had and improves the general legibility of information.
